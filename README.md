Even though nothing compares to actually reading a book and extracting the needed insights out of it as done by a human, Text Mining techniques provide a remarkably good glimpse into what allows for a thorough initial understanding of an 'oeuvre'.

In the present body of work, a comparative analysis of two major works of Adam Smith ("The Theory of Moral Sentiments" -first published in 1759- and "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations" -first released in 1776, and modified on several occasions throughout the remains of his life-) is realised.

Three broad Text Mining topics are covered: "working with multiple texts", "sentiment analysis", and "term frequency".
